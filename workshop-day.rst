Workshop Day Notes
==================

* Would be nice if it was clearer in the code bits of the tutorial where we have to type things in (terminal, file?)
* First `User.objects.all()` actually returns users.
* The example regex with r'blog/' in auto-generated urls.py is too similar to '$' and people think they need to just uncomment it.
